# HW3-Password-Generator

I started with new blank files from templates I created for standard stuff (I know there really is no standard stuff yet) then copied in the contents from the provided developement files. 

First I created the function generatePassword to return a fixed string, which worked. 

Next I used google-fu to look up how to build a password generator and added the string of available characters and the line that takes a randon character out of that string. 

Then the return string and for loop were added. at this point I am generating fixed length passwords.

Added a prompt to get the password length.

Commit working code
